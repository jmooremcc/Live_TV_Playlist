You're watching live Over-The-Air (OTA) TV in Kodi. While you're sitting there watching TV, Kodi is automatically changing the channel to each of your favorite TV shows without you lifting a finger. Is this a futuristic dream or is it a reality today? With the Live TV Playlist Addon, the future is now. This addon enhances your live TV viewing experience in Kodi because you now have the ability to create a playlist of your favorite OTA TV shows. When it's time for your show to air, the addon changes the TV channel for you a few seconds before the program starts, thus insuring that you don't miss any of your favorite shows.

So how does the TV Playlist do this? Live TV Playlist operates similarly to the audio playlists except it maintains a list of your favorite “Over The Air” (OTA) TV shows. The addon sets an alarm for each TV show in the list and when that alarm goes off, it tells Kodi to change the channel. This process occurs without your intervention, which means you can sit back and relax and enjoy watching your favorite shows.
